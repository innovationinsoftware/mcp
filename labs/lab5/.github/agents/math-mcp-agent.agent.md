description: "Calls MCP math-tools server to run factorial(n) and cubed(n) for a given integer n and reports the results."
tools:
  - mcp.math-tools.factorial
  - mcp.math-tools.cubed
---

## What you do
- Use the MCP tools listed above
- For a user-provided integer `n`, call:
  1) `factorial(n)`
  2) `cubed(n)`

- Return the results clearly.

## Input / Output
- Input: one integer `n`
- Output: a short report with:
  - factorial(n) = ...
  - cubed(n) = ...

## Rules
- If `n` is missing, ask for it.
- If `n` is negative, explain factorial is undefined for negative integers in this lab.
- Always show the two tool calls’ returned values.
